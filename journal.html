		  <h3><font face="courier">01 My Writing Abilities</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">In previous papers I have gotten positive feedback about the layout of my analysis or research on specific topics.  I feel like this is because I am a very organized person and I am scientifically minded.  I like the do research and organize my thoughts in a logical or sequential order so that it is easier to explain them or describe them later.  This continues on to how I wrote papers for previous composition classes as well.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">On the other hand, I feel like I struggle most when I get the task of writing creatively.  When given free reign to write I usually find it hard to find something to write about and to then put my thoughts on paper in a way that is entertaining or at least pleasant for somebody to read.  Another area that I have always been told I can improve in is vocabulary.  It would be beneficial for me to use a thesaurus when I write so that can be more descriptive of feelings, or analysis of topics, time periods, or characters.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">02 Plaigarism Workshop Part 1</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="calibri">Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work such as writings, solutions, or ideas as your own.  This can be different within different areas of study such as source code copied from a colleague or from a website, using the results of research and publishing them as your own, or copying assignments for classes.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">1) I have found that conductors of specific materials will have an electric current that is proportional to the voltage applied to them.  The materials are ohmic when the ratio of voltage to current is constant over a variety of different voltages. (I = V/R) with the ratio being called the resistance.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">In the above passage nothing has been directly quoted or copied from a source however the idea/concept was taken as my own.  The idea is one fundamental law of electricity and without proper explanation or credit the idea and resulting relationships have been plagiarized.</font></p> 
		  <p><font face="courier">2) Catherine Earnshaw, the main protagonist in Wuthering Heights is surrounded by conflict.  She wants the security and lifestyle of a certain social standing yet posses a wild, passionate nature.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">In the brief start of a character analysis of Cathy the plagiarism is subtle in unmarked quotations from a paper written by a university student as well as descriptions taken from a study website.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">One passage was the usage of someone else's ideas as my own and the other is blatantly copying someone else's work and using it as my own.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">03 My Writing Abilities Reviewed</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">In my first journal I elaborated on my ability to write in an organized and logical way.  This corresponds to the unity and Evidence/Development components of the rubric.  The unity component has to deal with the amount of control and consistency in the paper.  Staying on topic and organizing an assignment based on a certain theme coincides with is part of the rubric and is important in the flow of the assignment.  Organizing assignment points in a logical way falls under the Evidence/Development part of the rubric.  Being able to write thoughts or questions down in a way that is easy to follow for the reader is important in the overall style, flow, and understanding of the work.  The flow could be story or a set of steps to be followed but being able to write clearly and display evidence is crucial in developing an argument or opinion thoroughly.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">I also wrote that I struggled to write creatively and find a topic that I would be interested writing about.  This corresponds to the Audience Awareness and Distinction components of the rubric.  Selecting a topic that is interesting enough for a reader can be difficult yet is one of the most important parts of literature.  If no one takes the time to read what someone has written then how will they take the time to analyze the writing.  This is definitely and area for me to work on however the distinction component of the rubric is arguably more important.  This part is a culmination of all other aspects of the rubric but this is where papers that have been edited, reviewed, and revised some more go above and beyond.  This is an area that I can improve on especially in expanding the ways that I write or in what vocabulary I use or how I phrase my ideas.  </font></p>

		<div id="J4" class="tabcontent">
		  <h3><font face="courier">04 Reading an article rhetorically</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">The targeted audience can be two groups of people.  One would be the obvious choice of readers who live in the south or who have been to a Waffle House before since the author talks about the appearance and inclusive experience that would be familiar to those who have eaten at the chain before.  The second group would be somebody who has never had a Waffle House dining experience who can get a glimpse into the southern staple through a photo journal and accompanying observation about the state of the communities surrounding the chain.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">The goal of the project was to get a glimpse into the surrounding communities through the windows of the restaurant and while there reflect and observe on how the restaurants location and demographics contribute to the experience.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">The author of the story is Micah Cash.  He has previously worked with The Bitter Southerner before however spends a majority of his time with photo journals, installations, and painting with a focus on how the land and social past of an area contributes to its cultural geography.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">The author appeals to the credibility of his observations by setting the parameters for his project.  He sets rules for himself about what he will order at each restaurant as well as how he will take each photo.  The reasoning for choosing Waffle House instead of other chains is the commonality between the locations.  Each location is similar architecturally, geographically, and demographically setting a standard for other aspects about the chain and its visitors to stand out.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">Cash mainly appeals to pathos in the article appealing most to nostalgia and reflection.  The use of imagery describes the conditions inside and outside the iconic chain most notably the "globe lights, the red vinyl booths" and the view from their windows.  For a reader who either lives in the south or has ever been to a Waffle House it is easy to be drawn back to memories made inside the restaurant as well as agree with the fact that most of the chains are located in areas that are bordering different social classes.  This brings the reader into the reflective aspect of the story as the author challenges the reader to remember or observe for themselves the conditions of the people who live near or work at a Waffle House, most of whom have a desire to leave and get out of that period of their lives.  Which makes Waffle House a bridge in the eyes of the reader showing that it is a southern community diner however there can be drastic differences in those who eat there and those that work there collectively making Waffle House seem like a "Waffle Home".</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">05 Close Reading Strategies</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">I usually go about reading a text by going through the passage once just for comprehension.  Often, reading the text one time is all that I need to understand the basic idea of the passage.  However when I real the news or read for class I usually have to read two or three times to answer questions that I had about the text or to find information that can lead me to a different source.  When I read for leisure my interest comes from the type of connection that I can make with the text whether that be from an emotional response to the text, a similarity with my life or curiosity about the subject presented within the text.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">The strategies presented in the chapter that correspond with my approaches to reading are rereading the text, asking questions, and testing the text against my appearances.  I feel that rereading is one of the most important strategies I use since, especially when read quickly, important aspects can be overlooked.  After the first read is when I usually develop questions and those questions usually allow me to go back to the text to find answers.  Finally, testing the text against my appearances is really what keeps me interested in a text.  Being able to find a personal connection to your life, being challenged in your beliefs, or being struck by emotion while reading is what keeps me connected to the text and/or the author.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">06 Elements of Fiction and A Rose for Emily</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">My first impression of the short story was that it was an older piece that depicted a southern town in the middle of a transition period.  I initially didn't see Emily as a younger more typical version of a southern belle instead continually seeing her as an older figure as described within the first couple of paragraphs.  Upon second glance I found her to fit more and more into the role of a daughter that is depicted in southern works.  She fit the aspect of a southern belle by always following her fathers rules and being a follower more than a leader or thinker and always in the background even literally in photos.</font></p> 
		  <p><font face="courier">Though not talked about thoroughly Emily's father fits the role of the male lead of the house and even of the town in the older days since the narrator describes the house as it was respected and viewed as in the older days.  The father even knew town administrators well enough that Emily never had to pay taxes.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">The author starts out with a blunt description of Emily in contrast with the description of her house as it stood in the past.  She is now short and pudgy and the house an eyesore compared to the grandeur of how in once stood on the "select street".  There isn't much dialogue in the story but it stands out more as gossip and a way to compare the townspeople to Emily.  The dialogue is mostly gossip about Emily or a discussion of what to do with her.  This distances her from the townspeople making the contrast we have seen from the beginning even bigger.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">The setting of the story is a southern town in the mid 1920s which was a transition period for the southern United States.  Slavery was gone and the people who once made all their money from the agrarian culture of the south with the help of slaves now had to find a way to move on and rebuild their economy.  The status of Emily's family in the past shows that her father most likely owned slaves and made most of his money from there.  When he dies Emily is left on her own with no source of income and no strong male figure in her life pointing her in the right direction essentially freezing her in that moment in time.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">The idea of time is very important throughout the story.  Essentially the story can be split between three specific periods: While Emily's dad is alive, Homer's time, and after Homer.  Emily has a purpose, direction, and leads a privileged life while she lives with her dad.  Her father is strict which brings the town people to pity her however her social standing puts her well off in life.  When her dad dies she isn't convinced that he is dead and finally breaks down due to the realization that he is gone and she has no one to guide her through life anymore.  This in turn leads her to fall in love with Homer who can never truly love her back.  The townspeople can see how her relationship is going and in turn continue to pity her.  When Homer leaves Emily she does the only thing that she can do to get what she wants, she kills him and lays beside him until she can't anymore.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">Even after Homer has died he is still kept locked upstairs in a moment frozen in time.  The room made to look as if they were getting married untouched since his death.  This layout of the story and the three major moments in Emily's life demonstrate the repetition and emphasis on time, mainly the comparison between the old and the new.  Emily is frozen in the past and has no one to guide her into her new town.  The reader can identify the emphasis between the old and the new in the comparisons of the house.  No one has even been in the house for decades and is left alone to fall apart while the town continues to grow.  The town administrators are changing and the new ones ask Emily to start paying taxes to which Emily doesn't even know how to respond except to "talk to Colonel Sartoris"  which at that point has been dead for a very long time.  A key aspect of time included by Faulkner is that her watch is literally out of sight, tucked into her waistband.  And to further this point Emily is described as a fallen monument and confederate soldiers attend the service at her house which can be interpreted to signify the passing into a new era for the people of the south, a refocusing of the economy and their traditions.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">09 Meditation at Decatur Square Reflection</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">Meditation at Decatur Square shows the reader the development of the American south through past injustices represented by images of Decatur Square and the murder of Natasha Trethewey's mother.  Trethewey describes Decatur Square's monuments- a courthouse, a carved boulder, a statue of Thomas Jefferson, and a Confederate symbol.  All these monuments are connected by their relevance to the South's chaotic past, yet they are all representative of different time periods.  In particular the statue of Thomas Jefferson can be compared to the continuing racial development of the south and is engraved with "a creation story- his hand poised at the word- happiness.  There is not yet an ending".  This shows not only how Natasha feels about the death of her mother but also about the conflict that issues of race continue to bring to a majority of the South.</font></p>

		<div id="J10" class="tabcontent">
		  <h3><font face="courier">10 A Good Man is Hard to Find Reflection</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">One aspect of the text that stood out to me was the repetitive use of numbers and colors.  O'Conner often used numbers or references to an amount as a way to describe how far the family has travelled, how old each member was, or to describe their time period.  She also used colors to describe the people and the places they saw, everything from the color of their eyes to the soil along the highway had a color which also went to associate that character with a feeling often associated with the color.  The Misfit for example was associated with the black hat, black is often associated with death which is fitting since the Misfit is a murderer.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">I felt that the climax was reached after Hiram and Bobby took away the mother and daughter and the grandmother reaches a point of clarity before she tells the Misfit that he is one of her children.  The discussion about religion between the Misfit and the grandmother reveals that the Misfit was not as religious at the grandmother but that the grandmother was more concerned with her appearance to the world than with her relationship with God.  This is represented when it appears that she has forgotten how to pray and can only mutter the words "Jesus, Jesus".  O'Connor represents the divide between good and evil with the conversation between the murderer and the grandmother.  The climax is really where the truth is revealed or understood by the grandmother and she experiences a moment of clarity followed by the rejection of the faith by the misfit.</font></p>
		<p><font face="courier">"She would of been a good woman,” The Misfit said, “if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life".  This line represents that the grandmother always appeared to be good with proper clothing and manners and being a "lady" but that only right before she was shot was she truly good in the eyes of God.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">12 Essays Grady of Wright</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">The goal of Wright's "The Ethics of Living Jim Crow" was to demonstrate from an autobiographical viewpoint the discrimination, violence, and prejudice that African Americans experienced during the time of the Jim Crow laws.  Wright demonstrated the effects of the Jim Crow laws using his own credibility and experience to describe to the reader the lessons that all African Americans learned in order live in a predominantly white society without getting injured or killed.  This can be seen in each section of the essay as he moves from one point to another in his life describing lessons learned from each experience most having to do with how to act, speak, and think around white men.  Wright appeals to the readers emotions by describing the violence that he has personally experienced.  One example is from his time spent at a shop in Mississippi.  He witnessed a woman get brutally beaten by the shop owner and then accused by a police officer of being drunk and all he could do in return was watch and keep his mouth shut.  This story shows the inverted society that he lived in when a police officer which is often associated with safety is actively participating in the prejudice.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">The tone of the essay is personal and actively shows the submissive nature of African Americans during this time period for their safety.  The style and structure of the essay go hand in hand.  The style is informal and has a lot of dialogue using the colloquialisms of the time and with many asides about the author's opinion on the situation.  Structurally the essay is in the form of sections based on a specific memory and lesson that the author learned.  It is broken up into many little stories that all combine to display his full Jim Crow lessons.  Wrights uses his personal experience and opinions about the Jim Crow law's effect on the African American society at that time to show the violence and submission that these people were forced into.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">13 Nationalism and Reading the Confederacy</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">Benedict Anderson writes that nationalism is imagined due to the fact that nations can encompass billions of people and all these people will consider themselves of the same nationality.  In this sense the communities are imagined and in flux constantly expanding and were at some point created within the larger nation.  Anderson argues that the communities are not falsehoods but creations.  These imagined communities and nations are limited because space is limited.  Each nation has a border and is surrounded by other nations in a world with limited space for all of them to exist at the same time.  Each nation is also limited in its thinking.  Each nation is unique in culture and ideas giving each a unique but often limited view of how the larger union of nations should stand on these ideas.  The nations are sovereign because each is born out of a differing idea not accepted in the previous community.  The idea of nationalism and community is born out of the longing to be free from oppression which makes their creation sovereign.  The community of a nation is through the underlying commonality that is sensed by all residents of a nation.  This is what they pride themselves on and what they believe is worth fighting to keep.  These ideas for a clearer definition of a nation - a territory inhabited by people with a common descent, culture, and ideology.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">Timrod's poem "Ethnogenesis" describes the new southern nation of the Confederacy.  He describes the new nation that goes from "pine and palm" subtly describing the range of the states that have joined the confederacy thus far.  The people include those in that region, those that will fight under god and the ideals of the confederacy for their children and their way of life.  The main economic factor that Timrod brings up is the cotton industry.  The south will thrive under the "snow of southern summers".  He speaks of both the North and slavery in lines about foundations built on broken pledges and that the south teaches the rightful places of slaves in the interpretation of their rightful place from the teachings of Christ.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">The speech given by Stephens describes the new and rightful ideology of the Confederacy in comparison with that of the North.  He states that the rightful place of an African American is in submission to the "superior race" as is right in nature.  This is their primary economic structure.  The slaves are there to physically build the ideas and plans that the superior race has formed for them.  The people that are in this new nation are those who believe that the natural order is the superiority of the white race, but he leaves out specifics like the role of women and even makes it seem that white people of different class are equal as well.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">In combination of Stephens and Timrod the Confederate nation can be described as limited in boundary between the North and South.  The South believes that the natural order of society is the submission of African American to the superior race and the border of the Confederacy stops physically when the states borders are reached but ideologically when the people stop imagining order.  The members of this new community are those that share this common sense of belonging to the superior race no matter what class they belonged to before.  They all see themselves as the rightful and just guide of those in the submissive state through the eyes of God.  The sovereignty of the state is limited to those of the superior race.  Those in the community of African Americans are not in a sovereign state and have no freedom to choose this community or speak out about it.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">14 Kneel to the Rising Sun and Literary Theory</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">My first impressions of the text were sorrow and frustration for Lonnie and Clem since they are stuck in a system that is killing them but that they cannot really escape.  There is a strong depiction of race and class of the South after slavery.  The topic of race is touched upon in Arch Gunnard's opinion of the African American Share Croppers mainly demonstrated by the fact that he wishes they had tails so that he could cut them off.  The topic of class is less defined but still a main part of the story since Lonnie is a poor white southerner stuck as a sharecropper for Arch.  He more closely related to Henry Clem than Arch however he is forced to treat Clem as any other white would treat an African American at the time which tortures Lonnie.</font></p>  
		  <p><font face="courier">My literary theory from class was gender studies and queer theory.  I noted specific questions on the portrayal of masculine and feminine roles of the text and how strict the author was at following those roles.  As well as how does the author present the text?  The text is a very strict and traditional interpretation of the American south at the time.  There is a rich white man in control of those of a less class and race.  This man, Arch Gunnard, is a traditional representation of Southern masculinity, while Lonnie is seen to have no "spine" (less masculine) and identifies more with the African Americans in the story.  In this sense the author does not even touch upon the queer or gender fluid aspects of the theory which represents how it was depicted in society historically as well.  There are also only two females portrayed in the story Lonnie's wife and Arch's wife which do not have any significant roles except to stay in the house during any action of the story.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">15 The Grave Response</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">In "The Grave," by Katherine Porter, the author depicts the maturation of Miranda and Paul through the realization of life and death during a hunting trip.  Porter uses the grave, the dove, the ring, and the rabbit to portray a cycle of learning that the children go through at a young age.  The graves are described by "a pleasant small neglected garden" which offsets the natural response or feeling a darkness often portrayed by a cemetery.  It is there that the children discover the gold ring and the silver dove.  Doves often represent peace which is what Paul desires while Miranda finds appeal in the femininity of the golden ring.  It is here that she dreams of dressing and playing the role of a traditional southern woman.  She wishes to bathe, dress nicely, and live a life of luxury that her family's past could have offered her and the ring reminds her that she hasn't reached that stage in her life yet since it does not fit her.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">While the ring mainly represents femininity it can also represent the cycle of life and death.  This leads into the childrens' killing of the rabbit.  It is a normal act represented by Paul's ease at skinning the carcass however upon realization that the rabbit was about to give birth Miranda is struck with horror.  Horror and sorrow that was "buried" by her ignorance.  This is her realization of the knowledge that her brother already knows.  There is a balance between life and death and they have stopped life from happening by killing it before it was born.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">Miranda can also be analyzed as a non traditional female during this time period due to a lack of a female authority figure in her life.  This can be seen by the way she dresses and the older women's opinions of her due to her dressing more like a boy.  This nontraditional role leads her to dream of a proper pure life of luxury that is symbolized by the ring.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">18 Tate and Trethewey Reflection</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">"Ode to the Confederate Dead" reflects on the narrators memory and emotions associated with visiting a Confederate graveyard.  The narrator experiences very strong melancholy emotions as he views the graveyard scene from the fence.  He starts by using imagery to describe the orderly rows and setting of the graveyard while also depicting the vast differences between the dead and the natural life of the graveyard.  This is followed by intense memories and recognition of the reality that the soldiers faced and how the earth and society has grown up around the dead all the while forgetting what they died for.  These realizations lead to spontaneous breaks describing the leaves and atmosphere of the yard that are lighter and less intense than the act of looking and reflecting on the graves.  The author wants the reader to take away a reflection of the cause that the soldiers died for since it is easily forgotten.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">"Elegy for the Native Guards" by Natasha Trethewey is a reflection on the lost history and recognition for the Native Guard at Ship Island.  She uses repetition of descriptions to associate the physical elements of the island such as the unfinished roof or the lost monument to describe the lack of acknowledgment and clear separation between race during the early 20th century.</font></p>
		  <p><font face="courier">Both authors depict the lack of acknowledgment of the soldiers who played vital roles in the Civil War, however Tate uses the emotional response of the Narrator to portray the difference of life and death as well as the forgotten contributions of the soldiers.  Trethewey uses the imagery and experience of visiting Ship Island to display the contrasting treatment between Confederate soldiers and the Native Guards.  Tate uses the narrators feelings and descriptions to trigger the readers emotional response while Trethewey uses imagery and repetitions to appeal to the readers emotion and logic.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">19 Mayhem in the Industrial Paradise Reflection</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">In "Mayhem in the Industrial Paradise," Wendell Berry argues the negative effects of the coal mining industry on the socioeconomic structure of Kentucky.  The style of writing hints at the underlying religious and moral beliefs of Berry.  Berry tends to agree with the idea that "the earth is the Lord's, or it holds that the earth belongs to those yet to be born as well as those now living"(175).  He follows by disputing the modern farming and mining practices determining that these practices only benefit the rich companies and drive a farther wedge between social classes.</font></p>

		  <h3><font face="courier">20 Kenan Reflection</font></h3>
		  <p><font face="courier">Kenan's "Foundations of the Earth," depicts the social and religious values of small southern towns.  Through the use of religious imagery, character insights and irony Kenan represents the oppression of the South's norms for race, religion, and culture to change.  The reader is first introduced to the religious aspect of the story through the Reverend who is at dinner but who also notices the tractor working on a Sunday which is "the Lords day".  A comparison can also be made between the biblical archangel Gabriel versus Edward's partner Gabriel.  One is a traditional view and strong religious figure while Edward's partner is part of two minority groups in the south.  This challenge to be both accepting to those around her as well as keep her faith force Maggie to change her outlook and opinions on both her religion and her social standing as she disagrees with the Reverend about her neighbor farming on a Sunday.  The change occurring in Maggie are accentuated by the structure of the story.  It begins at the end and jumps around in Maggie's past until the reader has enough background information to understand the full change that Maggie has gone through.</font></p>
