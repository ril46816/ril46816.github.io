		<p><font face="courier">My name is Rachel Iris Long.  I grew up on a small farm in Ballground, GA with my mom and my dad and soon after I started school my family moved to Alpharetta, GA.I am an only child so it could get lonely growing up and in that time I used to love watching my dad work.  This is where my love for physics and computers first started.  Soon I was able to help my dad at his company after school.  There I built computer and desktop systems and help run PC setup for his office.  I learned that I was a very logical person and math and computer science made sense to me.  I found myself nerding out over video games and my favorite shows are Star Trek and Forensic Files.  Watching these shows throughout my life fueled my desire to one day work for SpaceX or as a Forensic Computer Analyst.</font></p>
		<p><font face="courier">Both of my parents have supported and encouraged me for entering a primarily male dominated field.  My mom has always taught me to empower other women and I learned this the most by joining Girl Scouts.  As part of a larger group of girls I was always encouraged to support my peers and was taught "to leave everything better than you found it".  I always apply this to places, but I interpret this as how I impact others around me.  Towards the end of high school I put my passion for empowering women and computer sciene together for my Gold Award project.  I made a lesson about how to use personality types in school and team settings to help improve girls confidence.  I put together a website as well as lesson plan that I since donated to the Georgia Counselors Association that I taught to over 300 girls in my community.  I will keep striving to reach my goals and continue to help impact others in the most beneficial way.</font></p>
