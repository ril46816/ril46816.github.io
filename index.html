	    <p><font face="courier">Welcome to the Wild Card section of my portfolio!  This is a website that I created to supplement the qualities presented in the other sections.  It displays more informal information about myself.  Feel free to explore on your own.  The biography section is similar to my biography from the portfolio.  The Journals section is a collection of my journals from the class.  These demonstrate my thoughts and analysis of readings done in class and are presented in a less formal manner than a project.  To view a journal simply click which one you would like to see and it will display on the right side of the screen.</font></p>
	    <p><font face="courier">The last section of the site is the Wild Card section.  This is a collage of images from my inspiration board at home.  It is made of of images and quotes that keep me motivated and remind me that my goals are acheivable.</font></p>
	     <p><font face="courier">This site represents a collaboration between my creative and analytical sides.  As a part of the portfolio it demonstates my growth as a writer as well as an extension of the theme of my portfolio which involves my major, Computer Systems Engineering.</font></p>
